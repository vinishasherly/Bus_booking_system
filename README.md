# Bus_booking_system
I developed this project by using basic core java concept for the user to Book a bus ticket. This project is also developed by using JFrames. In this project the end user can view availability of seats and book accordingly based on their need.

Features âœ¨:
User can select their seats based on the bus name or bus number and bus timing, subsequently the system will collect the passenger details to proceed for booking the ticket.
